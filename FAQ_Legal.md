In the past we operated something called the Vuze® HD Network™, and we
will probably do that or something similar again in the future. With
that in mind it's important to recognize the differences between content
available from the Vuze® HD Network™, meaning that it is available
through vuze.com, on one hand, and on the other hand content available
and downloaded from other sites and bittorrent peer-to-peer (P2P)
application users using the Vuze® or Vuze+™ bittorrent P2P software
application client (for example, by downloading a torrent file from
another site or bittorrent P2P application client users, and then
opening or playing it from an application that plays bittorrent files,
including those that might be within a web browser, stand alone, or a
viewer/player that is part of a P2P application). In other words, it is
important to understand the distinction between content downloaded
*from* Vuze and content downloaded *with* or using the Vuze or Vuze+ P2P
apps. And by "content" we generally mean data files that may contain
written words, sounds, images, video, etc., which might be educational,
scientific, informational, political (including regarding civil or human
\[and animal\] rights issues), religious, entertaining, or any
combination.

For the content available from the Vuze site, we had and will have
strict copyright protection policies in place, and we worked and will
work hard to attempt to ensure that all content there was and is in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-definitions.html" class="external text">public domain</a>
(which means there is no copyright or all copyright has fully and
irrevocably expired), the use is a
"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" class="external text">fair use</a>"
under the United States Copyright Act, or otherwise, or all copyright
holders / licensors have represented that they are the copyright
"owners" or that they have the legal rights from all copyright owners or
holders (licensees) to authorize or allow the content to be downloaded,
uploaded, shared or otherwise used, manufactured, performed, displayed,
copied, etc., through the Vuze site (See the exclusive rights of
copyright holders under United States Law
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/" class="external text">here</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.copyright.gov/title17/" class="external free">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/</a>),
and we have no reason not to believe them. (If we had reason not to
believe them we wouldn't have that content available there. As a matter
of fact if you are the exclusive copyright holder of any works available
on or through the Vuze site and you would like that material to be
removed from the Vuze site please see our DMCA removal process
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.vuze.com/corp/dmca.php" class="external text">here</a>:

Content from the Vuze HD Network is the content that is displayed when
you have Vuze HD Network selected in the left navigation pane. You can
determine whether content in your Library that you have downloaded came
from the Vuze HD Network or not by looking in the "From" column. Only
content from the Vuze HD Network will have a blue frog displayed in that
column. Content from other sites will have other icons in that column
(for example, a round globe icon). (If you don't see the "From" column
in your Library, you may add it using the Column Setup dialog, as
described here: [Column
setup](/web/20190718041032/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Column_setup "Column setup")
)

In connection with content available and downloaded from other sites and
bittorrent P2P application users using the Vuze® or Vuze+™ bittorrent
P2P software application client, some copyright holders are okay with
people making and distributing copies of their works, without charging
for them or otherwise financially benefitting, but this may be a pretty
complex area of the law, and it isn't always crystal clear what a
particular copyright holder may be okay with that, and what the law is
or may be. For content from other sites and meta-search templates,
trackers, RSS feeds, or otherwise, we're not really in a position to
assess whether it is legal or not. There's content available legally via
the bittorrent protocol (from Vuze, the site and the application, and
from other sites and applications), but that's still not yet true of
everything that's available. Be sure to review the policies of the
individual site. Sometimes a copyright holder will actually inform you
that you can re-use or re-distribute their work, in whole, or in part,
including by notifying the world at large that a particular
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://creativecommons.org/" class="external text">Creative Commons</a>
type license is applicable to a work. Here is where Creative Commons
lists organizations and projects powered with Creative Commons licenses:

to post a recording of C-SPAN's video coverage of federal government
events online for non-commercial purposes so long as C-SPAN is

Even YouTube allows uploaders of videos to indicate that certain videos
can be edited, re-used, or re-distributed, in whole or in part (see,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.youtube.com/t/creative_commons" class="external free">http://www.youtube.com/t/creative_commons</a>).
However, we are not in a position to verify, let alone determine, what
other content available through Vuze® or Vuze+™ (the P2P client
applications and meta-search templates, trackers, other websites, RSS
feeds, or otherwise), is authorized for any use generally reserved to
the exclusive rights of the rights holder(s), including for personal
sharing/distribution, saving, or copying, or is available with the
permission of those who represent that they are the copyright owners or
have all the rights necessary to allow others to exercise or enjoy any
of those rights. It might be safe to assume, however, for example, that
currently any major commercial film studio motion pictures that are or
were recently playing in the theater, are not legally available for free
downloading. This may also be true about most television shows, and most
major music label sound recordings.

Vuze offers support only in connection with the accessing of authorized
files. Vuze should not be used to infringe the intellectual property
rights of others or to access unlawful materials. Because Vuze cannot
control the conduct of its users, users are responsible for their own
actions when using Vuze. It is your responsibility to ensure that you
are downloading, uploading, sharing, making available, and copying only
lawful and non-infringing content in your territory or country. We
assume, without verifying, that any content files that might be referred
to in any message, post, or conversation (if any at all) are either in
the public domain (again, meaning there is no copyright or all copyright
has fully and irrevocably expired), the use is a "fair use" under the
law, or all copyright holders have authorized or allowed the content to
be downloaded, uploaded, shared or otherwise used, manufactured,
performed, displayed, copied, etc. (See the exclusive rights of
copyright holders under United States Law

However, we are not in a position to verify what content available
through Vuze® or Vuze+™ (the application, the website, or otherwise), is
authorized for any of the exclusive rights of the rights holder(s),
including for sharing/distribution or copying, and therefore, cannot
provide you with assistance on emailing, downloading, uploading,
sharing, copying, or otherwise using specific content. We can only refer

Should you need any further, general assistance that does not concern
specific content, after reading the FAQs and following any
instruction(s) in it or them, please do not hesitate to contact us
again.

In any event, we strongly urge each user to act responsibly when it
comes to emailing, downloading, uploading, sharing, copying, or making
available any content.

The Vuze® and Vuze+™ P2P application also contains a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/FAQ_Meta_Search" class="external text">"meta-search"</a>
feature which enables users to search other third party web sites,
including torrent index sites. By default Vuze searches a limited set of
torrent sites. This feature, whereby Vuze has enabled a select few
search templates of a limited set of torrent sites, is provided as a
convenience to our users. We do not have any relationship with the
underlying sites and cannot attest to the legitimacy, safety or
completeness of any content that may be identified through such
services. Vuze selected and selects these torrent sites because it has a
good faith and reasonable belief that those sites track or host content,
the overwhelming majority of which content does not infringe upon the
rights, including copyright, of any third party. Vuze makes a good faith
attempt to determine the legitimacy and legality of these sites --
regarding those sites mostly or exclusively involving non-infringing
content -- based upon news reports, outcomes of lawsuits or governmental
actions against those sites, as well as periodically examining the
number of take-down requests received by Google for domains alleged to
be associated with infringing content. (See,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/" class="external text">Google Transparency Report</a>
\[
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/" class="external free">http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/</a>\],
and we encourage you to read Google's official blogs about its
Transparency report.) Vuze recognizes that simply because Google might
receive a lot of take-down requests associated with a domain, that does
not necessarily mean that there is a lot of infringing content available
on or through such sites, because take-down requests are simply
allegations of infringement, not proof that there was or is
infringement, many take-down requests are
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/faq/#compliance_reasons" class="external text">false, abusive</a>,
do not take into account
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html" class="external text">"fair use"</a>
under the United States Copyright Act and analogous laws of other
territories or countries, and might even be based upon
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/faq/#non_compliance_reasons" class="external text">falsified court orders</a>.
Further, there are reports that many take-down request involve attempts
to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/06/more-transparency-into-government.html" class="external text">suppress political speech</a>.
However, if Vuze becomes aware of an exceptionally high number of
take-down requests associated with a domain that has been in existence
for a reasonable period of time Vuze will typically not include, or will
remove, such site from its pre-selected search templates.

To the extent that users have occasionally received notices from ISPs
regarding the downloading of allegedly unlawful copies of content, we
believe these arise from the downloading of content outside the Vuze HD
Network. It is each user's responsibility to ensure that they are only
downloading and uploading lawful and non-infringing content -- wherever
it may be found. One such source of lawful and non-infringing content
is, of course, the Vuze HD Network. In any event, we strongly urge each
user to act responsibly when it comes to downloading and sharing
content.

The links above and below lead to some third party materials that may be
helpful to you in understanding your rights and obligations. We disclaim
(have no) responsibility in connection with your following or clicking
on any links. We recognize that there are a variety of viewpoints
regarding what might be a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_file_sharing" class="external text">complex area of the law</a>
involving the uses (or occasional misuses) of neutral technologies such
as the Vuze® and Vuze+™ P2P applications, and content available through
such P2P applications, and some of the viewpoints expressed by third
parties might be biased or controversial, at the very least. But we
can't expose you to all the resources on viewpoints, studies, laws,
social movements (including civil disobedience), policy positions,
alternative methods to compensate copyright holders (such as compulsory
or collective licenses), and even religions (e.g.,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190718041032/http://kopimistsamfundet.se/" class="external free">http://kopimistsamfundet.se/</a>).
We encourage you to learn more, though. Other than supporting and
respecting the rights of creators, artists, and rights holders under the
laws as they exist (and that isn't to say that certain laws should not
be modified, or that the interpretation or application of those laws is
always fair or just, or do not have unintended consequences), and being
against copyright infringement and other misuses of P2P technology, we
just provide a neutral technology and do not take a position endorsing
or supporting any particular viewpoints, . . . except that we are also
against censorship and are in favor of legal free speech (not all speech
is legal). Also, we encourage you to support authors and artists whose
works you like. But ultimately, unfortunately, we can't give you advice
about any of this. You might want to consult with an experienced and
good lawyer who knows about these issues, or ask some public interest
groups to publish information on these topics and help you stand up for
your rights. Also, this was written with the laws of the United States
principally in mind, as we understand them, though may of the same
principles apply elsewhere. If you are outside of the United States you
might want to look into what the laws are of the territory where you
are, and the
