## <span id="What_devices_are_supported.3F" class="mw-headline">What devices are supported?</span>

See our list of [Supported
Devices](/web/20180620030324/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Supported_Devices "Supported Devices")

  

## <span id="What_platforms_are_supported_for_devices.3F" class="mw-headline">What platforms are supported for devices?</span>

Device Playback is supported on all Intel-based Mac OSX and Windows
operating systems. Devices **is not supported** on Linux operating
systems or on PowerPC-based Macintosh.

-   Not sure if your Mac is PowerPC? Open "About Vuze" from the Vuze
    menu, and check the "System" area in the bottom right. The line that
    starts "Mac OS X" will have "ppc" at the end on PowerPC Macs.

## <span id="Devices_does_not_show_up_in_my_left_pane" class="mw-headline">Devices does not show up in my left pane</span>

On Windows, see if Vuze is setup properly in your firewall

## <span id="How_do_I_control_whether_my_content_is_converted_for_my_device.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I control whether my content is converted for my device?</span>

Vuze will make a best effort to determine whether your content can play
on your device already or needs to be converted first.  But if you set
your "user proficiency" setting to "Intermediate" or "Advanced" (Tools
menu, Options -> select Mode) then the "format conversion" dialog will
include additional options to control the content transcoding.

  

## <span id="The_burn_process_appears_to_hang" class="mw-headline">The burn process appears to hang</span>

Converting and Burning a DVD may take several hours to complete. If the
icon next to the progress bar is spinning, the burn process is running
normally and is not hung.

  

## <span id="Content_conversion_is_taking_a_long_time_but_the_conversion_isn.27t_even_using_all_of_my_CPU" class="mw-headline">Content conversion is taking a long time but the conversion isn't even using all of my CPU</span>

If you have multiple CPUs or multiple cores, you can control the number
of threads (and thereby increase the amount of CPU being used for the
conversion) in the Vuze options.  Select Plugins \> Vuze Transcoder and
change the option "Threads to use for transcoding"

  

## <span id="I_checked_the_.22Remember_this_setting.22_for_the_conversion_setting_and_now_I_want_to_make_a_different_selection._How_do_I_get_the_selection_dialog_back.3F" class="mw-headline">I checked the "Remember this setting" for the conversion setting and now I want to make a different selection. How do I get the selection dialog back?</span>

Right-click on the device entry under Devices (on the Mac hold the
"control" key down while you click on it) to get the "advanced options"
context menu.  Under "Default Profile" select "Ask every time".

  
<span id="ProfileSelection"></span>

## <span id="My_video_is_being_converted_to_480x320._How_do_I_increase_the_resolution_of_the_video_copied_to_my_device.3F" class="mw-headline">My video is being converted to 480x320. How do I increase the resolution of the video copied to my device?</span>

Undetected phones and HTC phones will default to 480x320.

If you know your phone's display resolution, you can tell Vuze to
transcode to a higher resolution by right clicking on the device,
selecting "Default Profile" and choosing the resolution that matches
your device.

<a href="/web/20180620030324/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:HTCProfiles.PNG" class="image"><img src="/web/20180620030324im_/http://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/5/5e/HTCProfiles.PNG" width="545" height="412" alt="HTCProfiles.PNG" /></a>

## <span id="How_do_I_automatically_convert_content_for_a_device" class="mw-headline">How do I automatically convert content for a device</span>

You can do this by using categories. First of all enable categories by
right-clicking on a download and selecting the 'Assign Category' menu
item. Then select the 'Add Category' option and enter a name for your
category. You will notice that at the top of the Library view, under the
filter box, some buttons appear - these are the category buttons. You
can right-click on these to set properties. One such property is the
'Auto-Device' property - select this and navigate through the menu
hierarchy to the device and transcode profile you want all downloads in
that category to be transcoded to.

If you really want to play around here you will notice that you can
assign categories to subscriptions - you can use this to, for example,
have all downloads that come from a subscription auto-converted as
desired. You could even set up your own subscriptions using the 'Local
RSS' feature and create a feed from your transcoded files to share with
your friends...

\[Note: to set this up for **all** downloads use the built in
'unassigned' category (you'll need to create a dummy category to get the
button to be shown). There is a bug in builds prior to 4.5.1.1_B10 that
prevents newly added downloads from being processed correctly so you'll
need to update to this version or higher\]

  

## <span id="What_is_the_Device_Playback_entry_in_my_left_navigation_pane.3F" class="mw-headline">What is the Device Playback entry in my left navigation pane?</span>

Starting with version 4.2, Vuze has support for taking the video content
you download using Vuze and preparing it to be played back on your TV
and other playback devices. In the 4.2 release, Vuze supports watching
your content using your Xbox 360, your PlayStation 3, or any of the
video devices that you manage with ITunes.

  

## <span id="Can_I_watch_content_on_my_PS3_or_Xbox_360_if_my_laptop_is_connected_via_WiFi.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I watch content on my PS3 or Xbox 360 if my laptop is connected via WiFi?</span>

For the PS3 and the Xbox 360, Vuze is acting as a Media Server that you
can discover from the device's interface. Because the PS3 or the Xbox
360 is reading the content from the computer running Vuze, your playback
experience will be impacted by the quality and speed of the network
between your computer and your device. If you are planning to run in
this configuration, you may get a better playback experience by
selecting "SD" in the "Media Conversion" options.

  

## <span id="How_do_I_get_content_to_my_device.3F" class="mw-headline">How do I get content to my device?</span>

Once your device is listed in the left navigation pane under the Devices
entry, you can make content available on your device by selecting it in
My Library and pressing the "Convert" button in the toolbar, or by
simply dragging it and dropping it onto the "Devices" entry or on the
actual device entry. You can also drag and drop content from anywhere on
your computer (using Windows Explorer, for example) to the Device tab.

For iTunes, Vuze will launch iTunes when the conversion is complete and
will push the content into your iTunes Library. From there you can
transfer it to your Apple device.

For Xbox 360 or the PS3, while your Vuze is running, navigate to the
Vuze media server to view your content.

## <span id="Can_I_stream_content_to_my_iPad.2FKindle_Fire.2Fetc.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I stream content to my iPad/Kindle Fire/etc?</span>

Rather than copying content to your device for playback you can access
it via any web browser via the currently very basic 'Local RSS Feeds'
feature. To do this the easiest way is enable 'Pairing'
(Tools->Options->Connection->Pairing), enable 'Local RSS'
(Tools->Options->Local RSS etc) then click on your device in the sidebar
and select 'Publish RSS Feed'. Then go to your device and browse to

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180620030324/http://remote.vuze.com/?sid=rss" class="external free">http://remote.vuze.com/?sid=rss</a>

  
You want to follow the 'html' links to navigate to your content for
playback.

If you want to do this from outside your home network you will also need
to enable the 'map content port via UPnP' option in
Tools->Options->Plugins->Media Server (or manually open the port) and
set the Media Server content port to a specific value rather than
leaving it as 0 (0 means random)

## <span id="Can_I_organize_content_shown_on_my_device_into_folders.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I organize content shown on my device into folders?</span>

Some devices support folders so that instead of one huge list of files
being displayed you can structure your content to make navigation
simpler. TO do this for your Vuze content you need to use 'Categories'
(and, coming soon, Tags as well).

-   First you need to enable this feature via
    Tools->Options->Plugins->Media Server: create folders for categories
-   Next apply categories to your content by right-clicking on it and
    selecting 'assign category'

## <span id="What_do_you_mean_by_.22share_anonymous_device_statistics.22.3F" class="mw-headline">What do you mean by "share anonymous device statistics"?</span>

Why is Vuze collecting statistics about device usage? To be honest,
adding device support to Vuze is a complex undertaking. That's why we're
launching it as a "beta" in the first place, and frankly, we need your
help in order to get it right. By using the feature and providing us
with feedback you can help us make this feature really amazing. But by
letting us collect statistics about what is being used and how well it's
working, without any effort on your part you're providing us with some
of the most important information we need to fix problems and improve
our calculations

We are constantly striving to improve the Vuze Platform and the Vuze
user experience. Learning more about how you use Vuze, particularly new
features, helps us decide what to fix, what to build and how to
prioritize future improvements.

**What data would Vuze be collecting about my device usage?** We intend
to gather information on how many users ”turn on” support for supported
devices, which devices are the most widely used, and whether our file
conversion process is working at its best. We will not be gathering any
data regarding particular content users may be watching or downloading,
or the sources of such content.

**How does Vuze actually collect anonymous statistics?** At different
points while using the Devices features -- for example, when you drag a
piece of content to a specific device, or when Vuze calculates whether
or not the content needs to be converted to play back on that device –
your Vuze application will make a “web call” to vuze.com and communicate
to us statistics of which features are getting the most use.

**What will happen if I choose not to let Vuze collect anonymous
statistics?** If you choose to disable the collection of device
statistics, we won't make those tracking web calls. All other device
functionality will continue to be fully available. Of course, this also
means that information rearding your use of features and other
information that could be used to improve the product will not be
included in our data collection, and therefore will not be considered by
us in making future product development decisions.

## <span id="I_upgraded_iTunes_and_now_I_can.27t_see_it_in_Vuze" class="mw-headline">I upgraded iTunes and now I can't see it in Vuze</span>

On windows, if you upgrade iTunes, after you restart your computer you
may have to launch iTunes at least once for Vuze to be able to see it.
This is due to how Apple does its upgrade process.

  

## <span id="iTunes_does_not_appear_under_Devices_in_the_left_nav_even_though_iTunes_is_installed" class="mw-headline">iTunes does not appear under Devices in the left nav even though iTunes is installed</span>

This sometimes happens under Windows, and can usually be resolved by
simply re-installing the latest version of iTunes.

## <span id="Content_doesn.27t_stream_over_my_wireless_well" class="mw-headline">Content doesn't stream over my wireless well</span>

Streaming over wireless may be problematic because typically your
bandwidth will be more limited, more susceptible to other network
traffic causing interruptions or jerkiness in playback, etc. If you are
having difficulty playing content over your wireless connection, try
reconverting the content using the SD profile instead of the HD profile.

## <span id="Why_am_I_getting_Transcode_failures.3F" class="mw-headline">Why am I getting Transcode failures?</span>

When a device doesn't directly support a video file format it needs to
be transcoded from the original format into one the device can handle.
This process can fail for a number of reasons:

No video stream found - the transcode operation needs to identify the
format of the original video stream, if this can't be done you will get
this error.

In all cases you can check the transcoder log file for more information.
You can see this within Vuze by going to Tools->Plugins->Log Views->Vuze
Transcoder, or check the VuzeTranscoder_1.2/log files in the 'logs'
directory of the
[Configuration_directory](/web/20180620030324/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Configuration_directory "Configuration directory")
