<p><b>Availability</b> is a per-torrent score like 0.640 or 37.989. The major number of the <i>Availability</i> tells you how many copies of <b>the least available piece</b> of the torrent you currently see. If the availability is 1 or more, you see all of the pieces of the file(s). If it is 0, you do not see the whole file(s). The decimals are most useful when the Availability is below 1. Lets say availability is 0.652, that means you're only seeing 65.2% of the file. 
</p>
<ul><li> Availability reflects <b>your</b> <b>current</b> view to the torrent. It changes constantly based on the seeds &amp; peers you are connected to.</li></ul>
<p>Availability has a direct impact on download speed too. If you are downloading a torrent with good availability, the speed is usually much higher than in a torrent with only one source (as that the upload speed of that source will then limit the whole swarm's download speed). You can also see in the example image that speeds of individual torrents can vary a lot.
</p><p><b>You can (and should) easily enable the <i>Availability</i> column:</b> just go to <i>Library</i> tab in Vuze (or the <i>My Torrents</i> tab in Azureus), right-click on the header row where the downloading torrents are queued and choose <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Column_setup" title="Column setup"><i>Column Setup</i></a>. <i>Enable</i> the <i>Availability</i> column there and hit <i>OK</i>.
</p><p>Doing this will give you a new column where you can easily spot the <i>Availability</i> of the torrent. This is calculated based on the pieces available from <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seed" title="This funny word">seeds</a> and <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peers</a>, that you're connected to.
</p><p>Another option to see the <i>Availability</i> is to open the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/UG_Advanced_Information#General_tab" title="UG Advanced Information">torrent details</a> via <i>right-click &gt; Show Details</i> or doublecklicking on the torrent in the <i>My Torrents</i> view. The <i>Availability</i> is displayed there as a graphic bar and the Availability number itself on the right end of the bar.
</p><p>Availability shown in the Library view:

</p><p>Examples:
</p>
<ul><li><b>0.000</b> means that the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Tracker" title="This funny word">Tracker</a> is offline or doesn't track this torrent anymore and <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Distributed_hash_table" title="Distributed hash table">DHT</a> can't help either or there simply are no <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seed" title="This funny word">seeds</a> left (old torrent).</li>
<li><b>0.249</b> means there are only parts of the torrent available (in this case 24.9%). Try to wait for <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seed" title="This funny word">seeds</a>, you might have to wait a day or so. Or it is very new and in <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Superseeding" title="This funny word">Superseeding</a> mode</li>
<li><b>0.640</b> and all other peers stuck at nearly the same percentage (~64.0% in that case) means the torrent is either stuck because it lacks a seed or there is a very slow seed you're currently not connected to. Be patient, that torrent might finish, very slowly.</li>
<li><b>0.999</b> (or something below 1 near that) means there is <b>almost</b> 100% of the torrent available. This could be a anti-<a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Leech" title="This funny word">leech</a>-protection, meaning you just have to wait a few hours or days for it to get 100% of it. If you are already trying to get it for 2 weeks or so read the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Torrents_stop_at_99_percent" title="Torrents stop at 99 percent">Torrents stop at 99 percent</a> page.</li>
<li><b>1.000</b> means that there is currently 100% of the torrent available. You are only able to download this torrent when the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seed" title="This funny word">seed</a> won't go offline before you got all of it.</li>
<li><b>1.539</b> <i>and</i> many peers stuck at ~53.9% (check the torrent details) means the swarm is either a <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Bad_torrent" title="Bad torrent">bad torrent</a> or the only <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seed" title="This funny word">seed</a> is very slow and everybody is waiting for new data from him, thus you'll reach 53.9% very fast but the remaining 46.1% will take quite some time (could be hours or days) while the original uploader slowly uploads it to peers.</li>
<li><b>3.357</b> means there are some <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seed" title="This funny word">seeds</a> and <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peers</a> available and as you see at least 3 copies of each piece, you should be able to download the complete torrent, even if a seed stops seeding.</li>
<li><b>37.989</b> means that you are downloading a torrent with a big <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Swarm" title="This funny word">swarm</a>. You see at least 37 copies of all data. If the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Average_Swarm_Speed" title="Average Swarm Speed">Average Swarm Speed</a> is not too low you should be able to download it rather fast (partly depending on your upload too).</li></ul>

<p>Note that a good (high) Availability does <i>not</i> necessarily mean that it's a <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Good_torrents" title="Good torrents" class="mw-redirect">good torrent</a> (and also read about <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Bad_torrents" title="Bad torrents" class="mw-redirect">Bad torrents</a>). Another important thing is that seeds are NOT necessary to finish a download since peers can have data to share too, only an Availability above 1 (not counting cases with superseeds). That Availability &gt; 1.0 condition can be also reached with several peers having different pieces of data, so that combined they have all the pieces.
</p><p>It's perfectly normal not to connect to all <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seed" title="This funny word">seeds</a> and <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peers</a> in a swarm - more important is a good <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Average_Swarm_Speed" title="Average Swarm Speed">Average Swarm Speed</a>.

<ul><li><b>Choking:</b> This is something that is part of the BitTorrent protocol, in the network. <b>Choking is a signal that a <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> is not intending to send you any data, until you are unchoked.</b> This could be because the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> is not ready, or not willing to fulfill your requests. When you are connected to a <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a>, the connection contains information on 2 situations, one is choked or unchoked, the other is interested or not interested. <b>Interested means, that <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> has data that you do not have, and wish to acquire.</b> New connections to peers always begin as choked and not interested. Peers will unchoke connected peers who upload fast but are not interested. If the fast uploading peers subsequently become interested, then the worst uploader gets choked. If you are interested in what the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> has, then that <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a>'s client will calculate whether to send you the data, using information such as how fast you are uploading to other peers. When you are connected to many peers, you are never going to receive data from all of them at once. Sometimes data are sent to you from a particular <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a>, sometimes that <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> sends to another <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> instead, who may then upload to you. <b>It is not possible for every <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> to share data with every other connected <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> at the same time</b>.

So <b>choking is used to limit that congestion</b>, and to help make sharing faster. Choking is also used to make sharing fairer to all, by ensuring that peers who upload more data faster to others get more data uploaded to them.

This is a tracker feature. This is a feature that is useful if you have more than one active <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#.torrent" title="This funny word">.torrent</a> which is hosted on the same tracker.

This is why, you may sometimes see a message in the tracker column in the "My Torrents" view, saying <b>Multiple hash scrapes not supported</b>.

<ul><li><b>NAT:</b> This is short for Network Address Translation. This means that the Network, (which consists of any and all hardware you have connected up together, such as your router and your computer) needs to Translate the IP address of your router (which has it's own IP address) to and from the IP address of your computer (which also has it's own, <i>different</i> IP address). In simpler terms, it's sort of like mail forwarding. The router is there to help protect you from what it thinks is unwanted traffic, it is sort of like the Post Office. Inside the router, the port forwarding instructions are like telling the postman to redirect your mail to a different address. So the original address from the outside world (WAN, or Wider Area Network) is the IP address of your router, that's what the postman sees on the labels of parcels and letters. Then the postman redirects your mail according to the instructions you gave, to your ACTUAL address, which is the real local IP address of your computer, in the LAN (Local Area Network). See below for how to find out what the actual IP of your computer is on Mac OS X. So when you get the error message <b>NAT Error</b>, this means that your router is NOT translating the IP address from your computer to and from the outside world IP address of your router. And this is why no information or downloads can occur until this is sorted out, because information can not pass between your computer and the router, and thus cannot pass to and from the outside world of the internet.

<p>You normally have only one physical connection to a network at a time, but often use it for more than one thing, or logical connection, at a time. Ports are used to tell the operating system, which logical connection the received data packets are intended for.
</p><p>For example, web browsing with Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) usually uses port 80 while File Transfer Protocol (FTP) normally uses port 21. When you request a webpage, your computer sends a request packet to port 80 on the server, as it expects the web site's server to wait for your call at the default port. Port numbers run from 0 to 65535. Some of them are "reserved" for official purposes. You can go to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210427182632/http://ports.tantalo.net/">http://ports.tantalo.net/</a> , the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210427182632/http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">official IANA port list</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210427182632/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_well_known_ports_(computing)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_well_known_ports_(computing)</a> to find out more about which ports normally belong to which protocol/program.
</p><p>The general advice is to use a randomly selected port between 49160-65534. Please read <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Select_port_for_Vuze" title="Select port for Vuze">this article</a> for more information on which ports to use with Azureus. 
</p><p>Originally bittorrent implementations (like Vuze/Azureus) used the port 6881, but as some ISPs started to block that port, Vuze currently recommends to use some other port and it randomly selects a port for a new installation. The selected port number itself does not change the functionality, as long as you configure your own network accordingly.

When a <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> is snubbed, only one request is queued to the snubbed <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> at any one time.  A peer is unsnubbed if they fulfill the one request they're given within 60 seconds.  In some conditions, requests are not made from snubbed peers at all, such as when a torrent is almost complete and there are other unsnubbed peers available to make the requests from. The most likely reason for the offending peer is a misconfigured client. It may be uploading to too many peers without enough upload capacity.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>SSL:</b> This is short for <b><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210427182632/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">Secure Sockets Layer</a></b>. This is a protocol developed by Netscape Communications. SSL makes it possible for encrypted, authenticated (i.e. by username and/or password) communication over the internet. It is possible to transmit private files this way. SSL is often used in communications between web browsers and web servers. For example, when you buy something over the internet, and you go to a secure page to enter your personal sensitive information such as credit card details, the URL beginning with "https" will indicate that this is an SSL connection. SSL is also used for people to securely access their home machines remotely when they are away from home.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Superseeding:</b> a feature that allows seeders who are the <i>only</i> seed in the swarm to solely seed pieces that are found nowhere else in the swarm. It works something like this: the superseeding client pretends not to be a seed, but pretends to be a <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> with an incomplete file. Then the client shares each piece with one <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> only. And that <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> can then share that piece with the swarm. This allows the superseeding client to maximise the efficiency of the upload by only sharing those pieces nobody else has. And because of some other things about the behaviour of superseeding, this function does not work at all well in swarms with one <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Peer" title="This funny word">peer</a> and one seed only. So it is only good when the seeder is the <i>only</i> seed (usually the original uploader), and there are more than two peers. For more information please see <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/Seeding_Rules" title="Seeding Rules">Seeding Rules</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Note: Do not enable super-seeding for a torrent where you are not the only seed.

<p>Please note that the total number of seeds and peers in the swarm is just the tracker server's current knowledge. It is no absolute truth. Some of the seeds/peers might already have closed their bittorrent clients and are thus no longer active. There is a defined time delay since last contact, after which the the tracker forgets about a seed/peer.

<ul><li><b>Tracker:</b> a tracker is a special server that contains the information needed for peers to connect to other peers. Trackers coordinate the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/BitTorrent" title="BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> clients, and also keep track of statistics and verification information for each <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#.torrent" title="This funny word">torrent</a>. Azureus contains its own built-in tracker, but there are a variety of other tracker software packages in use. If the tracker server goes down and you try to start a <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#.torrent" title="This funny word">torrent</a>, you won't be able to connect to the swarm. Usually tracker errors are temporary, so Azureus will keep trying to <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Scrape" title="This funny word">scrape</a>/connect again until successful or the <a href="/web/20210427182632/http://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#.torrent" title="This funny word">torrent</a> is removed. Please do <b>NOT</b> use the <b>Manual Update</b> button! The more you click it, the more this will destabilize the tracker, and cause it to go offline for everybody. So for the most part, leave the Manual Update button alone.
