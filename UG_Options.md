This page gives an overview to the options offered in Azureus/Vuze
(current version when writing: 4.5.0.2).

Please note that **the exact outlook of options in your Vuze depends on
three things:**

-   Your *User proficiency* in Mode options. (See below)
-   Your operating system. Some of the options are specifc only to
    certain OS (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)
-   Selected Vuze interface. Some options are related to Vuze interface
    (az3), while some concern only the old Azureus interface (az2).

This allows you to alter the complexity of the controls that are offered
to you. You might choose to set this to avoid the possibility of messing
up the settings.

*Beginner* just allows managing of torrents, *intermediate* allows local
trackers and many settings, *advanced* allows access to everything.

-   *Beginner* is the default level for new users, and it hides some
    options and menu commands, which the users might inadvertently
    misuse. It also hides many available fields in [column
    setup](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Column_setup "Column setup")
    dialogs.
-   ***Intermediate* is the recommended level for most users who have
    managed to find this wiki.**
-   *Advanced* offers all the options for your tinkering, if you
    understand their function.

**Since version 4.4.1.0, the Mode options page also contains a button to
reset Vuze's main settings to default values.** This button can be used
for reverting back to defaults, if you think that your vuze settings
have got too messed up.

## <span id="Startup_options" class="mw-headline">Startup options</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">\[</span>[edit](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=UG_Options&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Startup options")<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">\]</span></span>

Options for the actions you can set Vuze to do at startup/shutdown. The
availability (and working) of the various options depends on your
operating system.

<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze4604OptionStartup.PNG" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/5/5f/Vuze4604OptionStartup.PNG" width="640" height="500" alt="Vuze4604OptionStartup.PNG" /></a>

  

-   **<span style="green">Start Vuze on login</span>** For Windows and
    OSX setting this will cause Vuze to automatically start when you log
    in
-   **<span style="color:goldenrod">Start in low resource mode</span>**
    Enabling this option causes Vuze to startup in a state that attempts
    to minimize the use of system resources. It is particularly useful
    when combined with 'start Vuze on login' option (although not
    required) so that Vuze is always running (seeding etc) and ready to
    enter a fully active state when you add a new download. It reduces
    system resource usage by not instantiating the user interface at
    all, only using UDP networking and reducing DHT activity. Once Vuze
    is activated it is currently not possible for it to return to this
    state.

-   **<span style="color:firebrick">Max simultaneous outbound
    connections attempts</span>**This options set limits how many
    connection attempts can be "half-open" simultaneously.
-   **<span style="color:firebrick">Bind to local IP</span>** This
    option allows you to bind Azureus to a specfic IP address and thus a
    (virtual) network device. This may be useful if you have multiple
    internet connections. It can be used with the
    [multi-instance](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Commandline_options "Commandline options")
    flag and the LAN peer finder plugin to run multiple Azureus
    instances to use more than one line for downloading. VPN clients can
    be used to create a separate virtual network device, such as VyprVPN
    which creates a new Local Area Connection with the Device Name:
    TAP-Windows Adapter V9 (as of this writing). Using the local IP
    address from or the name of this adapter with the bind setting will
    force traffic through that adapter; when the adapter is later
    disabled, traffic will cease. Using the network name is more
    effective as many VPN clients have dynamic IPs assigned each time
    you connect, however, a quirk has been found in that the name should
    be made all lower case to work properly. **This section needs more
    details and examples.**
-   **<span style="color:firebrick">Bind to local Port</span>** This
    sets outgoing connections to a fixed source port. This can be used
    with
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220417141153/http://wiki.vuze.com/#Different_types_of_NAT" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:full cone NAT">full cone NAT</a>
    routers to reduce the number of NAT table entries and thus prevent
    crashes on some router models. When the outgoing port is bound to
    the same as the incoming port that might even solve [NAT
    problems](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/NAT_problem "NAT problem")
    on full cone NAT routers.

*Note*: Binding to the same port as the incoming port works under
Windows 2k and greater only. Unix users should use a different port.
It's not working at all under Mac OS X.

-   **<span style="color:firebrick">Line maximum transmission
    Unit</span>** The greatest amount of data or "packet" size that can
    be transferred in one physical frame on a network.
-   **<span style="color:firebrick">Socket SO_SNDBUF size</span>** The
    TCP window size is implemented by send and receive buffers on each
    end of the connection. To set these buffers, the SO_SNDBUF and
    SO_RCVBUF fields need so be changed (KB).
-   **<span style="color:firebrick">Socket SO_RCVBUF size</span>** see
    Socket SO_SNDBUF size
-   **<span style="color:firebrick">Outgoing packet
    type-of-service</span>** Sets traffic class / type-of-service (TOS)
    field in the IP header for outgoing packets.

Azureus leaves this unset by default, meaning the defaults for the
underlying OS are used.

Example values are:

-   0x02 for IPTOS_LOWCOST
-   0x04 for IPTOS_RELIABILITY
-   0x08 for IPTOS_THROUGHPUT
-   0x10 for IPTOS_LOWDELAY

Underlying network implementations may ignore this value, so this option
is highly dependent on **OS** and **JRE** versions.

On Windows 95/98/NT for TCP sockets the IP_TOS socket option is ignored
and all packets are sent with the TOS set to 0.

On Mac OS X setting TOS does not work yet, due to a bug in Apple's JRE.

On Windows 2000 and XP IP TOS needs to be enabled via the registry
setting *HKEY\\LOCAL
MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters\\DisableUserTOSSetting*
as a *REG DWORD* type set to the value 0.

*Note:*Azureus 2.2.0.3 and newer will automatically set this registry
key for you when enabled (reboot required).

Some SOCKS proxy servers suffer from relatively high service disruption
(proxy server instances being unavailable, name resolution failing) and
this has lead to the introduction of the ability to use alternative DNS
servers for resolving the available IPs (along with some work to make
the proxy server selection more robust). Rather than place the
configuration under the Proxy section it has been allocated its own area
as in the future the use of alternative servers may well be extended
beyond its use for SOCKS.

By default Google DNS has been added to the set of servers.

Pairing is a feature that makes it easier for remote interfaces and
applications to link to Vuze.

Without pairing it is necessary to manually find the public IP address
of Vuze in order to connect to it. Often ISPs will periodically change
the IP address which means continually having to keep track of the
current one assigned. Also, each remote service will have a separate
port assigned to it, so this has to be kept track of as well.

Pairing automates this process by keeping an up-to-date record of Vuze's
public IP, along with the various remote services installed. An access
code is used to control access to this information, all that you need to
remember is this code. It is of course still possible to control access
to the individual services via username/password, the access code simply
gives access to the current IP and service ports your Vuze has defined.

Currently remote services need to be directly connectable from the
Internet - that is the relevant ports need to be open (either via UPnP
or manually configured)

Here you set Vuze to automatically adjust its speed limits either with
Auto-Speed Classic or with Beta version. You can set the functionality
to be active when downloading and seeding, or when only seeding.

**The main parameters for Auto-Speed Classic:**

-   The min/max limits for uploads
-   Max increase/decrease to the speed
-   The choking ping time (latency in ms). Lower time here means more
    sensitiveness for smooth internet traffic.

This set of preferences allows you to fine tune the way Azureus handles
the files it creates.

<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze45OptionFiles.PNG" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/f/f0/Vuze45OptionFiles.PNG" width="740" height="674" alt="Vuze45OptionFiles.PNG" /></a>

-   **Default directory** defines a directory path you would like your
    torrents to automatically download into. This is one of the most
    useful settings here, as it enables you to relocate your data
    directory for new downloads. If you have activated this option, it's
    still possible to download a torrent to a different directory by
    using the File -> Open menu.

<!-- -->

-   **Allocate and zero** tells Azureus to pre-allocate the space to be
    used by the file and fill that space with zeroes before it starts
    downloading the actual data of the file. This means that there is no
    chance that later Azureus will stall because there is not enough
    space on the destination disk. As the file is created at once, this
    option will also minimize fragmentation of the hard drive in
    comparison to incremental allocation. (If this option is checked,
    incremental file creation can not be used.)
    Note: Default for this option is 'disabled', but enabling this
    option might be beneficial for most users, as the whole files to be
    downloaded would be created when torrent is added to Azureus.
-   **Enable incremental file creation** will make Azureus increase the
    size of the file only as it is data is downloaded which means that
    you can trigger torrents that may take up a lot of space and that
    space will in reality remain available until actually needed to
    store file content. (If this option is checked, pre-allocation can
    not be used.)
    Note: Selecting this option will result in Azureus only reserving as
    much disk space as is necessary for writing the last piece it has
    received. For example, if it first received piece 125 of a 1000
    piece torrent, it would reserve space for pieces 0-125 in the
    torrent. If then it next received piece 500, the reserved space
    would increase to half the complete size of the torrent as pieces
    126-500 would be alloacated. So, although only two pieces (0.2%) of
    the torrent are downloaded, 50% of the disk space is still already
    taken. Because you may have several torrents doing this at once, as
    well as other processes writing to the disk, this method will result
    in more fragmentation than using pre-allocation. It may also cause
    unnecessary peaks to hard disk usage. Additionally, as pieces are
    downloaded in random order and priority based on piece rarity, this
    option is very seldomly useful.
-   **Append data to files as downloaded...** option enables Vuze to
    write downloaded pieces in mixed order and then arrange the file to
    proper order after the download completes. **Note: new functionality
    in version 4.5, use with own risk.**

<!-- -->

-   **Truncate existing files** will remove additional bytes at the end
    of a downloaded file (e.g. that has been imported from an other BT
    download tool). The option is most useful with MP3 files, to which
    some media players and inxeders (like Windows Media Player, Roxio,
    etc.) will automatically add tag information fetched from internet.
    See also info about [Existing data file length too
    large](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Existing_data_file_length_too_large "Existing data file length too large")
    error message.
-   **Re-check pieces when download is done** instruct Azureus to do a
    check at the end of download to be completely sure no piece of a
    file was missed. If any piece doesn't pass the error correction, it
    is simply discarded and downloaded again. This option may cause
    occasional high CPU usage on slow systems.
-   **Enforce exclusive file write access locking across torrents** This
    option was setup to deal up with issues involving multiple torrent.
    If you are getting errors that prevent download try removing this
    check. This page explains more:
    [Multiple_torrents_accessing_shared_file(s)](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Multiple_torrents_accessing_shared_file(s) "Multiple torrents accessing shared file(s)")
-   **Use Fast Resume mode** saves the state of your downloads into the
    .torrent file so that if you stop and restart a torrent it will
    resume 'instantly'. If you don't do this then Azureus will conduct a
    review of the download on startup to check the torrent content,
    which can take time. You can specify the interval between saves
    which will then be the maximum time you would loose if you had to
    restart. You can also instruct Azureus to save the information about
    peers to speed up restarts.
    -   **Update resume data every X minutes** defines how frequently
        resume data is written to the .torrent file.
    -   **On crash-restart check entire file for completed pieces...**
        forces Azureus it detects that in case Azureus detects that the
        session did not end gracefully, to make sure that the file
        contents are correct. From error correction perspective this is
        good, but it may also cause quite heavy disk activity when
        starting the session. Read also [Vuze did not shutdown
        tidily](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Vuze_did_not_shutdown_tidily "Vuze did not shutdown tidily").
    -   **Save peer connections for quick reconnects** caches
        information about the peers it's connected to and stores it in
        the .torrent file. This cached information makes it possible to
        connect to peers and seeders even in the case of the tracker
        going offline.
    -   **Max peers to save** sets the maximum number of peer
        connections to cache (per torrent), default is 512.
-   **Auto-prioritize files with extension...** lists extensions of
    files inside torrents that will automatically be given a download
    priority of High. Individual file priorities can be viewed on the
    files tab of the advanced view.
-   **Confirm when deleting data** request a confirmation before
    deleting downloaded data. Deleted data does not go to the recycle
    bin.
-   **Files to ignore when creating/deleting...** defines the files
    ignored when creating/deleting data files. Typically the low-level
    information files of the operating system.
-   **Move deleted files to the Recycle Bin** prevents the files being
    deleted completely for recovery purposes. If the operating system
    supports an Recycle bin / trashcan, it will be used.
-   **Backup configuration files for recovery purposes** tell Azureus to
    keep backup copies of the configuration files. At each Azureus
    session, the old configuration files are copied as .bak files (e.g.
    'azureus.config' to 'azureus.config.bak') in the [Configuration
    directory](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Configuration_directory "Configuration directory").

Notes:

-   With certain operating systems (Mac OSX, Linux ?) you may also see
    here options related to the XFS file system. If you get error
    messages that **XFS file allocation failed**, you may try to turn
    off the XFS option **Allocate new files using a method specific to
    XFS filesystem**.
-   Beta versions since 4.5.1.1_B05 contain an additional File deletion
    option related to the action for the 'Delete' button on the top

-   **Move completed files** will move the files from the download
    directory to another location when they are completed.
    -   **Directory** is the directory you want torrents to be moved to
        when they finish downloading and start seeding. Unchecking this
        option will result in torrents staying in the download
        directory. It can be hard to tell the difference between
        finished and incomplete torrents however, so it's recommended
        they be separated
    -   **Move .torrent** will also move the .torrent file from its
        saved location (see below) to the completed files directory. Can
        be useful to keep track of .torrent files for later reseeding.
    -   **only if in default data directory** will only move torrent to
        the completed directory if it was originally saved to the
        default data directory. This is useful if you have certain
        torrents you want saved somewhere else, otherwise when they
        finished downloading they'd just get moved into the completed
        directory with the others.

(of files included in a torrent). You can instruct Vuze to convert
foreign characters to local characters and you can define the default
character set to be used.

These options control how and when torrents are automatically removed
from Vuze.

-   By default, Vuze will only remove updates (for Vuze components) when
    they are no longer needed.

<!-- -->

-   Some trackers can issue an error response such as "torrent is not
    authorized by this tracker". You may configure Vuze to automatically
    drop the torrent when such error messages are received.
    This type of error message from a tracker can be generated if the
    torrent was never authorized by the tracker, or when the tracker
    administrator wishes to prevent further distribution of bittorrent
    content for a particular torrent. The latter case is common among
    trackers which distribute fansubbed anime, which eventually gets
    licensed - at which time distribution should cease. By enabling
    these features, you can help to prevent further distribution of
    bittorrent content that is no longer authorized for distribution.

These rules control how Vuze removes torrents automatically, either due
to errors or because torrents are Vuze updates.

-   **Friendly hash checking** by default, Azureus uses friendly hash
    checking. You can disable this in the configuration. Friendly hash
    checking does not lock up your system while it does the hash
    checking. For faster systems, this should not be a problem but with
    slower machines, it can lead your system to be unusable until all
    the hash checking is done.
-   **Enable disk cache** enables disk cache, this could help reduce
    disk fragmentation.
-   **Size of cache in MB** (default 4) Important: set it to 32 MB or
    less!
-   **Trace cache operations for diagnostic purposes**

    icon, nothing more
-   **Show download stats on hover** controls the availability of speed
    & activity stats, when mouse pointer is on top of the icon in system
    tray. *(Note: this is new option in 4.3, and earlier the default
    behaviour was to always show the stats.)*
-   **Allow Azureus to send ...**
-   **Show confirmation dialog on exit**
-   **Show confirmation dialog on torrent removal**
-   **Clear remembered dialog decisions**
-   **Drag and drop action for directories** sets the action for Azureus

    application. The actions can be to open the contained torrents, to
    share the directory, to share the directory's contents or to share
    the directory's contents and the contents of any contained
    directories.
-   **Reset explorer file associations** sets the .Torrent file
    extension to refer back to Azureus by default. This may be needed if
    other BitTorrent clients modify the reference.

    the tables. Enabling the option may also cause higher CPU load.
-   **Double-click in torrent views** sets the action for
    double-clicking a torrent's name in Library views. You can select
    between playing the file, showing torrent details and showing the
    files in folder. (Note: as of version 4.4 the option is visible in
    Vuze/az3 interface only, but it has effect also on az2/classic

This allows you to block connections to specified addresses. You might
do this to avoid known organizations or nodes that are behaving in ways
you may not find beneficial.

Note: The old Safepeer plugin is incompatible and obsolete with current
Vuze versions. The built-in IP Filters functionality has replaced the
need for the plug-in. Please read
[Safepeer_Migration](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Safepeer_Migration "Safepeer Migration").

The options available here:

-   **Enable** switches on the filtering by Azureus of IP addresses.
    That means you can enter a range of IPs that you don't want to have
    access to your computer (which will mean all other IPs will have
    access except the ones that you specify).
-   **ALLOW** which enables you to enable only specific IP addresses all
    others with be blocked.
-   **Save blocked IP ...** means you don't have to type the specific IP
    each time Vuze is started.
-   **Block peers that ...** adds the address of any sources of bad data
    to the block list. Associated options enable fine-tuning of the
    blocking rules.
-   **Ban a block ...** allows that once a few bad addresses are blocked
    in a small range then the range will also be blocked.

You can acquire standard blocklists. Otherwise you can add an IP address
or ranges of addresses along with a description for that specific range.

These options control how Azureus communicates with trackers.

-   **Limit the number of peers the tracker may return** sets the
    maximum number of peers the tracker may return to the client,
    default is 100. Initially set a peer limit to a small number like 1
    or 2. A peer limit of 25 may allow for faster connections to big

This is where you set up the Azureus' embedded tracker.

-   First you need to have a "fixed"? external IP address. Click on the
    "Check Address"? button and everything will be explained.
-   You can then choose the port on which the tracker will operate.
-   The "Tracker client poll interval (secs)"? is the time your tracker
    will ask the peers connecting to it to wait before asking the
    tracker again.
-   On the tracker URL, which will be something like
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220417141153/http://yourexternalipaddress:6969/" class="external free">http://yourExternalIPAddress:6969/</a>,
    you can choose to publish details about the torrents you are hosting
    (or just publishing). And the access to that webpage can be
    protected via a password ("Enable password on tracker web"?).

Vuze can publish RSS feeds for various things to allow these to be read
by other Vuze clients (for example). Currently this is supported for
Subscriptions (applies to all subscriptions, configure via Subscription
options), Categories (right-click on a category button to enable) and
Devices (right-click on individual device entries in the side-bar to
enable).

By default the RSS feeds are available via
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220417141153/http://127.0.0.1:6905/" class="external free">http://127.0.0.1:6905/</a>
- there is a very simple HTML UI to navigate to the actual RSS feeds
from here.

Note that for devices there is also an 'html' option that gives a way of
browsing the RSS resources in a browser (typically this is used to give
remote HTTP access to transcoded content on devices)

Control the most important aspects of the client's torrent queueing
behaviour. You set the download order of torrents by yourself, but for
the seeding torrents **Vuze has a queue system**, which tries to
prioritize the seeding torrents according to the rules/instructions you
give. By default it tries to run those seeding torrents which have
"highest demand" for data. The following example picture shows, how Vuze
has calculated a *Seeding Rank* for all completed torrents:

<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze45SeedingRankPic.png" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/2/29/Vuze45SeedingRankPic.png" width="734" height="488" alt="Vuze45SeedingRankPic.png" /></a>

The priority order of torrents is: *First priority seeding, download,
seeding*.

In the previous picture, the **Max active torrents** setting has been
set to 5 and **Max simultaneous downloads** to 2. Thus 2 *First
priority* seeding torrents, 2 downloading torrents and finally 1 normal
seeding torrent are started.

-   Please note that as the *First priority* status overrides the
    *Seeding rank*, the *First priority* torrents have been started
    despite their low Seeding rank.
-   Some of the torrents also have an asterisk ' \* ' in their *Seeding
    rank* column, which asterisk indicates that the torrent has been
    recently started and its **Minimum seeding time** is still going on,
    and thus the torrent will not be automatically stopped before that
    time has gone. Please see the Seeding options section below.

  
<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze5201OptionQueue.png" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/f/f8/Vuze5201OptionQueue.png" width="602" height="373" alt="Vuze5201OptionQueue.png" /></a>

The main Queue options:

-   **Max simultaneous downloads** sets the max. number of torrents that
    can be downloading at the same time. (Setting that lower than the
    *Max active torrents* leaves some slots for seeding torrents)
-   **Max active torrents** is the most important option of these. It
    sets the upper limit, how many torrents (downloading and seeding)
    can run at the same time. Setting it too high will lead to too
    little bandwidth for each torrent, so it makes sense to set the
    number reasonable according to your internet connection's speed.
    Read
    [Good_settings](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Good_settings "Good settings")
-   **Min simultaneous downloads** reserves some slots for downloads
    despite the priority settings. It is a way to guaranteee that you
    will not only have seeding first-priority torrents.

You can also set some limits how to handle really slow torrents and some
other minor settings.

[Downloading
rules](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/Downloading_Rules "Downloading Rules")
can be used to automatically determine the order of incomplete
downloads.

<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze5201OptionQueueDownloading.png" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/f/f9/Vuze5201OptionQueueDownloading.png" width="721" height="365" alt="Vuze5201OptionQueueDownloading.png" /></a>

Seeding rules are a set of rules that determine a torrent's [Seeding
Rank](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/This_funny_word#Seeding_rank "This funny word"),
a measure of how much it needs to be seeded. For the most part, the
options are self-explanatory.

<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze4310OptionQueueSeeding.PNG" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/4/43/Vuze4310OptionQueueSeeding.PNG" width="708" height="403" alt="Vuze4310OptionQueueSeeding.PNG" /></a>

The options at the Seeding page are rarely used, and most users can
leave them to default values.

-   **Minimum seeding time in seconds** tells Vuze how long it should at
    least run a torrent, if it gets started. A longer time value here
    decreases the constant swapping of the seeding order. Each time the
    queued torrent gets started, this time starts to run again.
-   **Use Super Seeding** mode is useful, **if you are the single
    original uploader** of a torrent. This mode tries to distribute the
    uploaded pieces as widely in the emerging swarm as possible, so that
    the original uploader does not get repeated requests for the same
    pieces from several peers. This is only useful if you are sole
    original uploader in a new torrent, (which you have created).
-   **Automatically reposition torrents based on Seeding Rank** is the
    main switch for queue logic. Turning that off leaves the seeding
    torrent queue to manual mode, and you have to change order by
    youself.

<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze4310OptionQueueSeedingAutoStarting.PNG" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/d/d3/Vuze4310OptionQueueSeedingAutoStarting.PNG" width="680" height="400" alt="Vuze4310OptionQueueSeedingAutoStarting.PNG" /></a>

These rules determine the seeding rank logic used for rank calculation.
There are several options to select from, with Peers:Seed Ratio being
the usual one.

Default values serve most users well.

#### <span id="First_Priority" class="mw-headline">First Priority</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">\[</span>[edit](/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=UG_Options&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: First Priority")<span class="mw-editsection-bracket">\]</span></span>

Here you can set the criteria governing which torrents receive first
priority. First priority overrides seeding rank, so a torrent with first
priority will be seeded until first priority no longer applies.

<a href="/web/20220417141153/https://wiki.vuze.com/w/File:Vuze4310OptionQueueSeedingFirstPriority.PNG" class="image"><img src="/web/20220417141153im_/https://wiki.vuze.com/mediawiki/images/6/67/Vuze4310OptionQueueSeedingFirstPriority.PNG" width="704" height="400" alt="Vuze4310OptionQueueSeedingFirstPriority.PNG" /></a>

The settings are rather self-explanatory.

As First priority torrents have higher priority than downloads, the
settings set here reflect your judgment which factors make the torrent
really important for seeding. Vuze forces at least 0.5 ratio as the
minimum for Share ratio.

These rules define your wishes to when Vuze should stop seeding
torrents. The torrents which match "Ignore rules" will not be started
automatically, and the torrents will stop when reaching a limit set
here. Naturally you can't set the Share ratio limit below 1.0.
